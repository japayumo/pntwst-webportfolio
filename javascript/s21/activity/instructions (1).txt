2. Create an index.js file and console log the message Hello World to ensure that the script file is properly associated with the html file.

3. Create a function called addNum which will be able to add two numbers.
	- 2 Numbers must be provided as arguments.
	- function should return the sum of the 2 numbers.
4. Create a function called subNum which will be able to subtract two numbers.
	- 2 Numbers must be provided as arguments.
	- function should return result of subtraction.
5. Create a new variable called sum.
	- This sum variable should be able to receive and store the result of addNum function.
6. Create a new variable called difference.
	- This difference variable should be able to receive and store the result of subNum function.
	- Log the value of sum variable in the console.
	- Log the value of difference variable in the console.
7. Create a function which will be able to multiply two numbers.
	- Numbers must be provided as arguments.
	Return the result of the multiplication.
8. Create a function which will be able to divide two numbers.
	- Numbers must be provided as arguments.
	- Return the result of the division.
9. Create a new variable called product.
	- This product variable should be able to receive and store the result of multiplication function.
10. Create a new variable called quotient.
	- This quotient variable should be able to receive and store the result of division function.
	- Log the value of product variable in the console.
	- Log the value of quotient variable in the console.

11. Create a function which will be able to get total area of a circle from a provided radius.
	- a number should be provided as an argument.
	- look up the formula for calculating the area of a circle with a provided/given radius.
	- look up the use of the exponent operator.
	- return the result of the area calculation.
12. Create a new variable called circleArea.
	- This variable should be able to receive and store the result of the circle area calculation.
	- Log the value of the circleArea variable in the console.

13. Create a function which will be able to get total average of four numbers.
	- 4 numbers should be provided as an argument.
	- look up the formula for calculating the average of numbers.
	- return the result of the average calculation.
14. Create a new variable called averageVar.
	- This variable should be able to receive and store the result of the average calculation
	- Log the value of the averageVar variable in the console.
15. Create a function which will be able to check if you passed by checking the percentage of your score against the passing percentage.
	- this function should take 2 numbers as an argument, your score and the total score.
	- First, get the percentage of your score against the total. You can look up the - formula to get percentage.
	- Using a relational operator, check if your score percentage is bthan 75, the passing percentage. Save the value of the comparison in a variable called isPassed.
	- return the value of the variable isPassed.
	- This function should return a boolean.
16. Create a new variable called isPassingScore.
	- This variable should be able to receive and store the boolean result of the function.
	- Log the value of the isPassingScore variable in the console.
